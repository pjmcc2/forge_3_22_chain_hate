# A Minecraft mod for Forge 3_22 
## That allows you to smelt chains into iron nuggets


Do you hate chains? Me too. Sometimes, especially in a Vault Hunters world, you have too many chains, and have nothing to do with them! 
This mod allows you to not only break chains down into cute chain links, but also allows you to then smelt the links into iron nuggets, finally giving them
a purpose beyond the cosmetic.
